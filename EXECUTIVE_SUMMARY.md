# Executive Summary: Website Enhancement Strategy
## Transforming Syntra Refining's Digital Presence

**Prepared**: February 10, 2026

## Current State

Your website has a strong foundation:
- ✓ Professional brand identity
- ✓ Clean, organized content
- ✓ Responsive design
- ✓ Good information architecture

A "wow" website signals:

**Q: Can we implement some now and others later?**
A: Absolutely. The phased approach is designed for incremental implementation.

**Q: What if we don't like something after it's built?**
A: All enhancements are modular and can be toggled off without affecting core functionality.

**Q: Will this require ongoing maintenance?**
A: Minimal. Quarterly updates to dependencies, but no heavy ongoing maintenance required.
