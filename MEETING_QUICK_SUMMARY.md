**The foundation is excellent.** Professional design, good infrastructure, strong branding. Marketing materials since December show great progress.

**But we have critical issues** that are hurting operations right now (broken career app, no email notifications).

**The ask:** Commit 1 week of dev time to fix critical issues, then 1 month for Phase 1 enhancements to compete with industry leaders.

**The result:** Industry-leading website that converts visitors to customers and positions Syntra as the sophisticated, innovative company we are.
